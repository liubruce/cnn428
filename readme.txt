3. Download  pre-trained GloVe vectors from : http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

4. zip the glove.6b.zip to move the text files into the directory glove.6b and then move the directory "glove.6b"
    to the directory where the programs files are exist.

3. Run the program using either ways:
   a. run: "python main.py embedding_layer"
   b. run: "python main.py word2vec"
   c. run: "python main.py pre_trained_Glove"
